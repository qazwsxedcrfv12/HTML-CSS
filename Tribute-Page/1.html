            <p id="img-caption">Bhagat Singh (1907 – 23 March 1931) was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts
                of dramatic
                violence against the British in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian
                independence movement.</p>

            <h2>Some interesting facts about Bhagat Singh</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bhagat Singh was a Sandhu Jat,born in 1907 to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati at Chak No. 105 GB,
                    Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India,
                    present day Pakistan. </li>
                <li>In 1919, when Jalianwala Bagh massacre took place, Bhagat Singh was only 12 years old. He was deeply
                    disturbed by the incident. On next day, went to Jalianwala Bagh and collected soil from the spot and
                    kept it as a memento for the rest of his life.</li>
                <li>In 1928, the Simon Commission was headed by Sir John Simon to address the political issues in
                    India. Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against the Commission as it did not include a single
                    Indian as its members. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi
                    charge on the protesters which consequently led to death of Lala Lajpat Rai. He died on 17 November
                    1928.</li>
                <li>Deeply affected by the death of Rai, Singh made a conspiracy with revolutionaries like Shivaram
                    Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott but the plant couldn’t be excuted
                    properly and they killed John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police.</li>
                <li>Though Singh fled but later Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and 21 others wereght and cau charged with the
                    Saunders murder.</li>
                <li>While he was in Jail, he noticed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. Then, they
                    demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries and other hygienic necessities, as well as
                    availability of books and a daily newspaper. They finally land up to Hunger’s Strike. The hunger
                    strike inspired a rise in public support for Singh and his colleagues</li>
                <li>Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be
                    hanged on 24 March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23
                    March 1931 at 7:30 pm.
